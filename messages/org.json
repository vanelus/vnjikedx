  "backupDescription": "Automatically exports all available data from Salesforce production orgs by scraping the Data Export page and downloading all generated ZIP files. This command handles Salesforce's data export limitations by supporting configurable delays between downloads. It inspects the Export Data wizard landing page, extracts download links, and sequentially downloads all backup files to a specified directory. Files are named with the org ID and an incremental index (backup_ORGID_1.zip, backup_ORGID_2.zip, etc.). The first file downloads immediately, while subsequent files respect the configured wait delay to comply with Salesforce rate limiting.",

  "targetusername": "username or alias of  prod environnement",
  "waitDelay": "wait delay in seconds between file downloads (starts from 2nd file). Use 30-60 seconds for large orgs to avoid Salesforce rate limits. Default: 0 (no delay)"
